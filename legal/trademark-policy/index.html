        <div class="entry-content">
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Introduction and permission to use</span></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            This document (the "<span class="bold">Policy</span>") outlines the <a href="https://cardanofoundation.org/project/">Cardano Foundation’s project</a> (the "<span class="bold">Project</span>") policy for the use of our trademarks (the "<span class="bold">Marks</span>" are further detailed in Appendix 1 of this Policy). While our protocol is available under a <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/develop/lib/LICENSE">free and open source software copyright licence</a>, the copyright licence does not include an express or implied right or licence to use our Marks. If you would like further information about our rights, these <a href="mailto:info@cardano.org">can be made available on request</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The purpose of this Policy is not intended to limit the lawful use of our Marks. The purpose of this Policy is to prevent confusion amongst the community (and public at large) as to what we deem an appropriate use of our Marks and limit any misleading or damaging use of them. We also want to avoid any confusion about who are our official partners at the time of publication of this Policy. The official partners who are involved in this Project are: 
          </p>

          <div style="padding-left: 30px;">
            <p>
              1) <a href="https://cardanofoundation.org/">The Cardano Foundation Zug</a>, which is responsible for standardising, protecting, and promoting the Cardano technology;
            </p>
            <p>
              2) <a href="https://iohk.io/">Input Output Hong Kong (or IOHK*)</a> which is responsible for building the Cardano blockchain technology; and
            </p>
            <p>
              3) <a href="https://emurgo.io/">Emurgo</a> which is the commercial partner fostering the Cardano application ecosystem (together the "<span class="bold">Cardano Partners</span>")
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            We want to extend the use of our Marks as widely as possible insofar that such use is aligned with the Project and its <a href="https://cardanofoundation.org/foundation/">core mission values</a> to standardise, protect and promote the Cardano Protocol technology (the “<span class="bold">Values</span>”). This Policy describes what trademarks are covered by these guidelines, as well as uses of our Marks that are allowed without additional permission from us. If you want to use our Marks, or any other aspect of the Cardano brand, in ways that are not described in this Policy, please contact us for <a href="mailto:info@cardano.org">further information</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We want to encourage and facilitate the use of our Marks by the community since the Cardano Project was built in a spirit of collaboration. However, we want to do so in a way that still ensures that our Marks are meaningful as a source and quality indicator for the Cardano <a href="https://cardanofoundation.org/protocol/">protocol</a> (the “<span class="bold">Protocol</span>”) and any associated products and services continue to embody the Protocol’s the high reputation. This Policy therefore tries to strike the proper balance between: 1) our need to ensure that our Marks remain reliable indicators of the qualities that they are meant to preserve, and 2) our Cardano community members' desire to be full participants in the Project.
          </p>

          <p>
            Notwithstanding this Policy, we reserve the right to withdraw any permission and/or amend, challenge or restrict any use of our Marks where we consider that such use amounts to a violation of this Policy or any use that we view as detrimental to the Project.
          </p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p class="bold">
            2. Trademarks and usage
          </p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>
            The Marks that are covered in this Policy, from time to time, are owned by the Cardano Foundation, UID CHE-184.477.354, with registered address located at: Gubelstrasse 11, 6300 Zug, Switzerland (further details of our Marks including any up-to-date information, such as registration details, are available on request <a href="mailto:info@cardano.org">here</a>). The Marks comprise of Word Marks, Logos, and a combination of both, and are listed at Appendix 1.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some of our marks may not be registered, but effective use of a trademark may give rise to parallel unregistered rights in accordance with the law of the applicable jurisdiction. This Policy covers our Marks whether they are registered or not and we may revise this Policy as  appropriate from time to time in order to provide the Cardano community with an up to date account of the Marks.  This Policy and the rules contained herein are subject to change at any time. It is your responsibility to check this agreement periodically for changes.
          </p>

          <p class="bold">
            2.1.  Universal considerations and rules of use
          </p>

          <p>
            Whenever you use one of the Marks, you must always do so in a way that does not mislead anyone, either directly or by omission, about exactly what they are getting and from whom. The law reflects this requirement in two major ways described in more detail below: it prohibits creating a "likelihood of confusion" but allows for "nominative use". For example, you cannot say you are distributing the <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/">Cardano blockchain software code</a> (the "<span class="bold">Cardano Code</span>") when you're distributing a modified version of it, because people would be confused because they are not getting the same features and functionality they would get if they downloaded the software directly from us.  On the other hand, you may use our Marks to indicate that your product is compatible with the Cardano Code or that your product accepts ‘ADA’ payments or is compatible with 'ADAPAY’, for example.
          </p>

          <p>
            You also cannot use our Marks on your website in a way that suggests that your website is an official website of the Protocol or that the Cardano Partners endorse your website unless this is true. You can, though, say you like the Cardano Code, that you participate in the Cardano community and ecosystem, that you are providing an unmodified version of the Cardano Code, or that you wrote a book describing how to getting started using the Cardano Code.
          </p>

          <p>
            This fundamental requirement, that it is always clear to people what they are getting and from whom, is reflected throughout this Policy. It should also serve as your guide if you are not sure about how you are using the Marks.
          </p>

          <p>
            With the exception of the "nominative fair use" of the Marks, your use of our Marks is subject to the following rules (irrespective of whether you received automatic or explicit permission for use):
          </p>

          <p class="bold">
            2.2.  Rules for use:
          </p>

          <div style="padding-left: 30px;">
            <p>
              2.2.1.  Any use of the Marks indicates acceptance of this Policy;
            </p>

            <p>
              2.2.2.  Wherever possible, the Marks should be accompanied by the trademark symbol ™ and the following text (or an appropriate translation), for example: 
            </p>

            <p>
              “Cardano™ is a trademark of the Cardano Foundation, CHE-184.477.354”<br>
              Or<br>
              “Cardano™ is a trademark of Cardano Foundation, CHE-184.477.354, Gubelstrasse 11, 6300 Zug, Switzerland, in Switzerland and other countries”
            </p>

            <p>
              For materials in which only the Logo is displayed or both the Logo and the Word Mark (Cardano) are displayed:
            </p>

            <p>
              “Cardano™ and the Cardano Logo™ are trademarks of Cardano Foundation, CHE-184.477.354, Gubelstrasse 11, 6300 Zug, Switzerland, in Switzerland and other countries”; 
            </p>

            <p>
              In particular, a ™ should not be changed to an ® in a trademark notice by anyone other than the owner.  If you are unsure about whether our Marks are registered in your country, <a href="mailto:info@cardano.org">please contact us for additional guidance as to what trademark symbol you should use.</a>
            </p>

            <p class="bold" style="margin-left: -15px;">
              Use of the Marks that is strictly prohibited:
            </p>

            <p>
              2.2.3 You may not alter the Word Marks or Logos, such as changing the proportions of the design elements or the design itself, rearrange the spacing, alignment, or relative locations of the design elements (you may resize as appropriate but must retain all proportions);
            </p>

            <p>
              2.2.4 You may not, under any circumstances, use the Word Marks or Logos for illegal, defamatory or humiliating purposes, or any other purpose that may negatively impact the reputation of the Cardano Protocol, Cardano Code, or the Cardano Partners;
            </p>

            <p>
              2.2.5 You may not incorporate and or combine the Word Marks or Logos into a third party company’s marks, names, and or logos without prior written permission by Cardano Foundation;
            </p>

            <p>
              2.2.6 You may not use the Cardano Word Marks or Logos in a manner that is not truthful and fair, or in a manner that may be derogatory, deceptive or misleading;
            </p>

            <p>
              2.2.7 You may not use the Marks in ways that imply a greater level of sponsorship by or affiliation with Cardano Foundation and or any of the other Cardano Partner than actually exists;
            </p>

            <p>
              2.2.8 You may not use or register, in whole or in part, the Marks as part of your own trademark, service mark, domain name, company name, trade name, product name or service name in any part of the world;
            </p>

            <p>
              2.2.9 You may not use the Marks in association with the use or distribution of any software if you are also not in compliance with the copyright licence for that software; 
            </p>

            <p>
              2.2.10  Trademark law does not allow your use of names or trademarks that are too similar to ours. You therefore may not use, or otherwise register, an obvious variation of any of our Marks or any phonetic equivalent, foreign language equivalent, takeoff, or abbreviation for a similar or compatible product or service in any part of the world.
            </p>

            <p>
              2.2.11  Any use the Marks not permitted by this Policy requires advance written permission of the Cardano Foundation. If you are unsure whether a use is permitted, <a href="mailto:info@cardano.org">please contact us for guidance</a>.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            You agree that you will not acquire any rights in the Marks and that any goodwill generated by your use of the Marks inures solely to the benefit of the Cardano Partners.
          </p>

          <p class="bold">
            3.  Permission for use
          </p>

          <p>
            Written permission from Cardano Foundation is required to use the Marks as part of your project or associated assets. For further information about how you can obtain our permission to use our Marks you can contact us <a href="mailto:info@cardano.org">here</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            3.1.  Use that does not require written approval
          </p>

          <p>
            In some special cases, we will grant automatic permission for a project to use the Marks. Explicit permission to use the Mark is not required when a project meets the following criteria:
          </p>

          <p>
            You exclusively use the Marks to either extend or improve the Cardano Code, or to encourage the use of the Cardano Code (in short — "foster the Cardano Protocol Blockchain software"), provided such use does not imply an official sponsorship or endorsement by the Cardano Partners and only where this Policy is strictly observed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Examples:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Permitted use: An open access, free monthly newsletter called "Cardano Weekly”</li>
            <li>Permitted use: A freely distributed Cardano theme called "Gold Plated Cardano"</li>
            <li>Not permitted: A Cardano fork called eg. "A Non-Sucky Version of Cardano”</li>
            <li>Not permitted: Selling T-shirts with the Cardano logo to raise money for another cause</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The Marks are used in a domain name, title of website, seminar, software package, book, magazine or video that is exclusively intended to support the Cardano Code and Project, provided it does not imply an official sponsorship or endorsement by the Cardano Partners and only where this Policy is strictly observed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Examples:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Permitted use: A non-commercial website called: howtoinstallcardano.com</li>
            <li>Permitted use: A keynote called “Getting Started with Cardano”</li>
            <li>Requires Permission: A book titled “The Official Cardano Blockchain Guide”</li>
            <li>Requires Permission: A commercial website called cardanohosting.com</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You want to display the official Cardano logo (whether for commercial or non-commercial use) in a standalone and unaltered form, provided it does not imply an official sponsorship or endorsement by the Cardano Partners and only where this Policy is strictly observed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Examples:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Permitted use: Putting the Cardano Logo on your product packaging after you have and obtained our prior permission to do so</li>
            <li>Not permitted: Changing the colours or shape of the Cardano logo for your purposes</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You want to use the Marks in a descriptive manner to describe your product or services provided it does not imply an official sponsorship or endorsement by the Cardano Partners and only where this Policy is strictly observed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Examples:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Permitted use: referring to your services as specialising in Cardano development</li>
            <li>Permitted use:  Input Output HK (IOHK*) Cardano Developers</li>
            <li>Not permitted: referring to yourself as “The Official Cardano Consultant” or “Certified Cardano Consultant" (this does not apply to the Cardano Partners who may refer to themselves as Cardano Consultants)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The press and media may make fair use of the Marks in reporting regarding its activities, function, research and products and publications. This also applies to any reporting about the activities of the Cardano Partners and where the use of the Marks is necessary
          </p>

          <p class="bold">
            3.2.  Events and Meet-Ups
          </p>

          <p>
            You may use the Marks for the title of an event, camp or meet-up, but not in any manner that may imply official sponsorship or endorsement by the Cardano Partners, unless such official sponsorship or endorsement exists. For example, using words like “conference” or, shorthand, “conf” and “foundation” may imply a degree of formality that could be construed by the Cardano community that an official sponsorship or endorsement subsists. Accordingly, and where no such relationship exists between you and the Cardano Partners, we require that you refrain from adopting this terminology in conjunction with your use of the Marks in order to avoid confusion about the nature of the event.
          </p>

          <p>
            You may use the Marks in connection with events, camps, and/or meet-ups provided  that you  strictly observe this Policy (including our rules of use set out in paragraph 2.2 and the requirements of this paragraph 3.2) and you follow the following requirements:
          </p>
          <div style="padding-left: 30px;">
            <p>
              3.2.1.  Your use of the Marks at the event, camp or meet-up reflects favourably on the products and services offered by the Cardano Partners and on the Cardano Protocol; 
            </p>

            <p>
              3.2.2.  A disclaimer of sponsorship, affiliation or endorsement by Cardano Foundation, similar to the following, is included on the publication of all event, camp or meet-up related electronic and or print marketing materials:

          <p>
            When organising an event, camp, and/or meet-up, please ensure that you have the time and resources required to organise them. For the benefit of our community and its members please also ensure that they are located in safe and easily accessible venues. It is important to bear in mind that these events should mirror our Values and we ask you help us build upon the same through your participation. We want to keep engaged with the Cardano community, and, so, if you want to run an event or have any questions regarding the use of the Marks, <a href="mailto:info@cardano.org">please do not hesitate to ask us</a>!

            3.3.  Use that does require written approval 
          </p>

          <p>
            In some specific cases, you will always require explicit permission from Cardano Foundation in order to use the Marks. Even if you meet the criteria for automatic approval, you must always seek our permission to use the Marks if your project meets any of the following criteria:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>The use of the Marks suggests an "official link" between your product or service and the Cardano Foundation; </li>
            <li>The use of the Marks is in a domain name;</li>
            <li>The use of the Marks is in an incorporated company name;</li>
            <li>The use of the Marks is used on specific branded products of goods and or services. </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Examples:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A domain called officialcardanofaq.org  (this does not apply to the Cardano Partners who may include the term ‘Official’ as a prefix in conjunction with the term ‘Cardano’)</li>
            <li>A corporation named Cardano Foundation Development Ltd</li>
            <li>A brand of ‘Certified Cardano Support Agency ‘ or 'OFFICIAL ADA WALLET’ (this does not apply to the Cardano Partners, namely IOHK)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The Marks are used as part of a "cardano.tld" top level domain name.
          </p>

          </ul>

          <p>
            The Marks are used as part of a domain name that covers an entire category of products or services that are relevant to the Cardano community. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The Marks are used as part of the name of a company, organisation, trade name or association.

            3.4.  Use Specimens
          </p>

          <p>
            In some jurisdictions, we may be required to demonstrate the use of our trademarks after a certain period of time in order to maintain their validity.

We may contact you and request that you provide us with such evidence from time to time.
